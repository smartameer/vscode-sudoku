Sudoku is a logic puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers from 1 to 9, following some simple rules. The grid is divided into nine 3x3 squares, and each row, column, and square must contain each number only once. Sudoku is a great way to exercise your brain and improve your concentration and reasoning skills. You can now play Sudoku on VSCODE.
